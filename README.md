A high-schooler's attempt at building a console POS system

This program was my very first attempt at a "large-scale" project. This was very shortly after I started learning C++, back in 2008, in high school.

Looking at the code, it's pretty decent for a first program, but I still laugh thinking about what my teacher accused me of at that time - "You lifted this off of the internet!"

I mean, obviously, no one in her class had attempted a program of "this scale" - most programs were only 50 lines or so (not to say that a larger program is more impressive - but I guess that's how the metric works for amatuer programming teachers).

Looking at my code now - it was useless to use classes - I might as well have used structs - there was hardly any OOP, hardly any modularity, it's architecturally terrible. The logic is still pretty strong though, and I'm proud of that. But there's no way you would have found that code on the internet! (Until now :D )
